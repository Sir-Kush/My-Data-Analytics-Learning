# Project 1: Iris Dataset Analysis (In-progress)

This project is part of my learning journey in data analytics using Excel. The Iris dataset is widely used for understanding various statistical techniques, and I am using this dataset to practice fundamental data analysis skills.

## Project Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes the following features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

In this project, I will perform basic statistical analysis on these features using Excel and document my findings.

## Goals
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Import the Iris dataset into Excel.
   - Perform data cleaning (check for missing or incorrect data).
   
2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Calculate the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of each feature (sepal length/width, petal length/width).
   
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Create charts (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to visualize the distributions of sepal and petal lengths and widths.
   
4. **Documentation**:
   - Document the process and results in this README and my GitHub repository.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Google Sheets** (optional): For cloud collaboration and additional data manipulation.
  
## Progress
- **Status**: In-progress
- **Current Stage**: 
   - Data cleaning and exploration in Excel.
   - Calculating basic statistics for sepal and petal lengths/widths.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize data cleaning and ensure there are no missing or incorrect data points.
2. Complete the calculation of descriptive statistics for all features.
3. Start creating data visualizations in Excel to represent key findings.
