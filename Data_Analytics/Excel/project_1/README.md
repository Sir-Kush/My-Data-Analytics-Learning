# Project 1: Iris Dataset Analysis (In-progress)

This project is part of my learning journey in data analytics using Excel. The Iris dataset is widely used for understanding various statistical techniques, and I am using this dataset to practice fundamental data analysis skills.

## Project Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes the following features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

In this project, I am performing basic statistical analysis and visualizations using Excel to understand the key characteristics of the dataset.


## Dataset

### Navigating the Iris.csv File
The dataset used in this project is the **Iris.csv** file, which is located in the following directory of this repository:
You can access the file directly through the link below:
- [Iris.csv](./Data_Analytics/Excel/project1/Iris.csv)

### How to Use the Dataset
1. **Download the File**: Click on the link above to download the `Iris.csv` file.
2. **Open in Excel/Spreadsheet**: Once downloaded, open the file using Excel, Google Sheets, or any other data analysis tool.
3. **Columns in the Dataset**:
   - **SepalLengthCm**: Length of the sepal (in centimeters).
   - **SepalWidthCm**: Width of the sepal (in centimeters).
   - **PetalLengthCm**: Length of the petal (in centimeters).
   - **PetalWidthCm**: Width of the petal (in centimeters).
   - **Species**: The species of Iris flower (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, Iris virginica).

## Goals
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - **[Completed]**: Imported the Iris dataset into Excel.
   - **[Completed]**: Performed data cleaning (verified that there are no missing or incorrect data points).

2. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - **[Completed]**: Calculated the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for each feature (sepal length/width, petal length/width).
   
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **[Pending]**: Create charts (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to visualize the distributions of sepal and petal lengths and widths.
   
4. **Documentation**:
   - In-progress: Document the process and results in this README and my GitHub repository.

## Tools Used
- **Excel**: For data analysis and visualization.
- **Google Sheets** (optional): For cloud collaboration and additional data manipulation.
  
## Progress
- **Status**: In-progress
- **Current Stage**: 
   - Data cleaning completed.
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation) calculated for all features.

## Next Steps
1. Finalize data visualizations in Excel to represent the distributions and key findings for each feature.
2. Summarize insights based on the statistical analysis and visualizations.
3. Push updates to GitHub.
